# SchopCraft
SchopCraft is a mod influenced heavily by the EnviroMine mod, the Tough As Nails mod, and the external game Don't Starve. It's intended to make Minecraft harder, cooler, and... something in-between.

NOTE: This is technically a "Work-In-Progress" (WIP). More crap will be added.
Requires AT LEAST Forge 14.23.1.2555; for Minecraft 1.12.x as of 01/05/2018
