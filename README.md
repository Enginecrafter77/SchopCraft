# Survival Inc.

Tired of the all-same routine every day? Do you want something more... let's say, special?
Wait no more! Survival Inc. corporation is proud to present you our newest product in a line!

Survival Inc. mod is a mod focusing on providing generic survival related stats, such as body
heat, hydration, and mental sanity. All this awesomeness comes thanks to our cooperation
with Klein Enterprises' "Don't Famish" game. Therefore, all stats in this mod are influenced
by the ones present in their game. And it was totally not a business espionage.

## Features
Not convicted yet? Well, look at few features Survival Inc. provides:
 * Body heat stat, stating how warm you feel
     * Directly corelates with the biome you're in
     * Is influenced by cave dwelling (or underground in general)
     * Heat exchange rate is proportional to humidity
     * If you're feeling cold, just create some fire!
     * Lava can also provide sufficient warmth
 * Hydration stat, showing how (not) thirsty you are!
     * Excess body heat can induce a lot of sweating!
     * Going on a vacation to nether without some water is also not a good idea!
 * Mental sanity, or how crazy you become if not treated well!
     * Staying in a spooky environments is not, well, normal...
     * Low light levels tends to adversely affect you
     * Staying awake long in night also isn't very good for you
     * Being dipped in water-soaked clothing can be very annoying!
     * After all, the nether vacation the travel company has been offering to you isn't such a good idea
     * On the other hand, animals (and other players) tend to make very good companions!
 * Wetness, or how deeply your clothes are soaked with water
     * Bathing in your clothing causes it, well, to soak up the water
     * The nature can be merciless, and so the rain also gets into your clothing
     * Being wet increases the rate at which you dissipate heat. In other words, you can get badly cold if bathing for too long!

### Ghost Mode
Do you think the respawn mechanic in Minecraft is just way too simple? Have you ever thought how this can be exploited
by some players? Damn, have you ever asked any meaningful questions? Anyway, the waiting is over! Survival Inc. has also
though about this, and our R&D team has brought up a very good question: "Dude, do you thing there is a life after the death?"
Our answer to this question is: "Yes, there IS!". With our patented devices, we created a realm for ghosts to freely roam
the landscapes. In reality, the ghosts are just slightly irradiated and heavily ionized souls of the players. This way, it
effectively denies them to grow up a new body immediately. Instead, the ghastly soul needs to wander around the landscape, searching
for our patented devices which can be used to revive those poor souls. And our devices are totally not powered by any sort of magic
power whatsoever. Don't ever listen to those journalists. They just want all the fame for themselves.

Inside Survival Inc. business tactics department, we are considering transporting the ghost devices into a separate corporate
division, therefore lightening those guys beefing up the stats system. But those guys in fancy suits have not yet decided what
to do. As such, we are focusing on our own work for now.

## Contributing
Do you want a part time job at Survival Inc.? Do you want to finally make yourself really useful?
Survival Inc. has you covered. We are currently seeking help with the graphics. Apparently, our
current artist is not felling well today. As such, we seek a new icons for use in our new mod.
More specifically, we would like a new logo designed. Apparently the old logo gives creeps to some
of our staff. They have commented about seing a sheep face in their dreams. At first, we decided to
ignore those comments, but then the staff care interjected, so we have to listen to their orders now.

Oh, you say you are a programmer, not an artist. Well, we might also have some dirty work
for you to do. In case you are decided what to do, write a letter to the CEO of Survival Inc.
In that case, fork our repository and when you are done with the changes, make a pull request.

## API
Our team of programmers at Survival Inc. has also thought about other programmers out there.
We have provided a whole-new API for interacting with the stats using a centralized manner.
As such, you may use Survival Inc. mod for developing whole new stats. For better overview
of the API, see the wiki (which is currently being worked on).
