# SchopCraft
Making Minecraft harder, cooler, and something in-between.
Still being refined and defined.

Eventually, this mod will add hardship with new mechanics added to the game, new ways to survive, new ways to influence magic, and new ways to influence yourself (and possibly others, if you're good).

Requires AT LEAST Forge 14.21.1.2387; For Minecraft 1.12.x as of 11/26/2017

NOTE: This is technically a "Work-In-Progress" (WIP). Crap will be tacked onto this mod in the near future.
