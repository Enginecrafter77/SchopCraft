# SchopCraft
Making Minecraft harder, cooler, and something in-between.
Still being refined and defined.

Eventually, this mod will add hardship with new mechanics added to the game, new ways to survive, new ways to manipulate magic,
and new ways to manipulate yourself (and possibly others, if you're good).

You may check out the main forum thread here:

Requires at least Forge 14.21.1.2387 for Minecraft 1.12 as of 07/30/2017

NOTE: This is technically a "Work-In-Progress" (WIP). Crap will be tacked onto this mod in the near future.
